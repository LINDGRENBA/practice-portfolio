      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>
        They don't allow you to have bees in here. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine. Look what the homosexuals have done to me! You can't just comb that out and reset it?

      <p>
        A Colombian cartel that WON'T kidnap and kill you. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months. It's hard to gauge time. She calls it a Mayonegg. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass!

      <h2>Get In Touch:</h2>
      <p>
        Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. Quicken! Premiere! Why are you squeezing me with your body? Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper. It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette.
